# Geospatial Raster Data Processing in Python
This repository contains an introduction to geospatial raster data processing in Python. This is part of the course on [Advanced Geospatial Analytics with Python](https://hamedalemo.github.io/advanced-geo-python/intro.html) taught since Fall 2023 at Clark University. 

## Requirements

You need to have Docker installed on your machine. 


## Instructions

It's recommended to pull the Docker image from Dockerhub. Otherwise, if you prefer, you can build your own image using the instructions in the following section. 

```
docker pull hamedalemo/raster-tutorial:1.1
```

`R``
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 hamedalemo/raster-tutorial:1.1
```


- Copy the Jupyter Lab url and paste it in your browser. 
- Open `raster_analysis.ipynb` and `raster_processing.ipynb`, and follow the instructions. 


Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t raster-tutorial .
```

Run the container as following after switching to the repository's directory locally:
```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 raster-tutorial
```
- Copy the Jupyter Lab url and paste it in your browser. 
- Open `raster_analysis.ipynb` and `raster_processing.ipynb`, and follow the instructions.
